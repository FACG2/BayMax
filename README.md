    >“Responsive Web Design always plays important role whenever going to promote your website.”  
    ― Josh Wilson

    We are crazy in coding and problem solving and this is one of the main reasons, we have decided to join the coding boot camp, because we want to put what's in our heads into a set of actions to achieve sensible results of our own ideas and practice coding, to develop a comprehensive understanding of concepts and teamwork and this portfolio website is only the start!


* ## WHAT is BayMax website.
    A one page portfolio built to give you an overview about who we are as a team of four cooperative, awesome coding boot camp student-develop!

    And also to show you what we can do for a trial website from scratch taking into consideration our clients' stories and other features like our services.




  * ## HOW it all started.
      **1. Clients stories.**
    [Users stories](https://github.com/gazaskygeeks/bootcamp/blob/master/coursebook/week1/project.md) tell us what needs to be included in the website and what features/requirements we need to focus on. In the case of this project:
      * Headline about the team with concise description.
      * Navigation link to sections; About us, Services, Team and Contact us.
      * Form with Name, email address and Message of the inquirer.
      * Small devices compatibility.
      * Visual impairment compatibility.
      * Old browsers/devices (IE7) compatibility.

      **2. Sketching and wireframing.**
     Wireframed as follows:
      * One-page layout.
      * Four main sections; About us, Services, Team and Contact Us.
      * Each section is connected to its menu button in the html code without using JS.
