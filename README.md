>“Responsive Web Design always plays important role whenever going to promote your website.”  
― Josh Wilson

  We are crazy in coding and problem solving and this is one of the main reasons, we have decided to join the coding boot camp, because we want to put what's in our heads into a set of actions to achieve sensible results of our own ideas and practice coding, to develop a comprehensive understanding of concepts and teamwork and this portfolio website is only the start!
